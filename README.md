## 🔧 Header Component System

The new Header component provides a complete authentication system:

### Authentication Features
- **Login Modal** - Username/password authentication
- **Register Modal** - Full registration with validation
- **User Profile** - Avatar, name, email management
- **Session Management** - Persistent login state
- **Logout** - Clean session termination

### Usage Example
```jsx
<Header
    isAuthenticated={isAuthenticated}
    user={user}
    onLogin={handleLogin}
    onLogout={handleLogout}
    onShowProfile={handleShowProfile}
    currentPage="quiz"
/>
```

### User Object Structure
```javascript
{
    id: number,
    name: string,
    email: string,
    avatar: string,
    createdAt: string,
    stats: {
        totalQuizzes: number,
        bestScore: number,
        averageScore: number
    }
}
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Quiz

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```

## 📋 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

}
```

### Adding New Questions

```javascript
const mockQuestions = [
    {
        questionText: 'Your question here?',
        imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
        answerOptions: [
            { answerText: 'Option 1', isCorrect: false },
            { answerText: 'Correct Answer', isCorrect: true },
            // ... more options
        ]
    }
];
```
